v1.1.3
    Released: 2016-06-28 08:56:38 +0200

    - Use the top-level ``.gitignore`` instead of the one in the current
      directory. Previously, the entries in the current-level ``.gitignore``
      were paths from the top-level and therefore useless.

v1.1.2
    - Central license file

v1.1.1
    - GPL2+ license.

v1.1
    - Makefile with install target.

v1.0
    - Initial release.
